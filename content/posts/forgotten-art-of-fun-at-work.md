## Simple reminders for simple ways to enjoy their work more

For all the times we value no sugar-coating, we forget to tell teams how to say things with a smile.

For all the times we value efficiency, we forget to tell teams how to do things with joy.

For all the times we value risk-taking, we forget to tell teams to receive the results with laughter.

For all the times we value respect, we forget to tell teams to make fun of themselves.

For all the times we value collaboration, we forget to tell teams to have fun.
