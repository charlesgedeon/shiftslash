No, not paper flyers—this is not a write up on the rights of cheap handouts given out by a club promoter with too much hair gel. I’m talking humans on planes; the people that Boeing doesn’t care about.

The tragedies that happened on Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 were part of a lazy attempt at Boeing to compete with Airbus while [saving major costs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-28/boeing-s-737-max-software-outsourced-to-9-an-hour-engineers).

The company’s [stock suffered](https://www.reuters.com/90c/article/us-boeing-stocks/boeing-shares-dip-again-as-more-countries-ground-737-max-8-planes-idUSKBN1QT1OV) big time...

![Boeing’s share price.](https://content.markitcdn.com/markets.on.nytimes.com/research/tools/builder/api.asp?sym=BA&duration=3&chartstyle=ArticleInline&w=395&h=220&display=fillclose&scale=2&topLabel=%20&showChange=0&backgroundColor=FFFFFF&fillColor=ddd&line1Color=333&line2Color=C7D0D5)

But that alone isn’t enough...

That they have the audacity to say they will fix this issue with a mere software upgrade and expect people to board without skepticism is absurd. The US and its regulators have [proven poor upholders](https://www.wired.com/story/boeing-737-max-8-ethiopia-crash-faa-ground-safety/) of people’s safety before nationalist/capitalist concerns.
