A woman sits on a park bench, writing in her notebook. Another types on her phone.

Our perception is that the former is noble, and the latter a drone.

Is there something unsettling about the multitude of activities possible on an obscure device – one may either be writing a novel or hashtagging a vapid photo?

Will this change when a new tech comes around?
