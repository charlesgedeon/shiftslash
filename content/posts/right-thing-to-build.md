## A few short words for those intrepid project-starters and entrepreneurs

A new project looms. Questions arise in the mind of creator, “Should I begin building or is it a pointless endeavor?”

The self-critic kicks in alongside the big dreams and visions of a better future, flaring up volcanic levels of dissonance in the mind. To avoid the burn, some friends and family are consulted. “What if you focus on this instead?” they ask, “Wouldn’t that make more sense?”

Advice of this sort is like balm on a sprained ankle; the pain fades until the balm evaporates. Curing the symptom is always easier than the root cause. In the heart of the adventurer, distinguishing the two is hardly possible. Instead they apply more balm, and say they are on the brink of discovery.

As our intrepid soul digs deeper into the tunnel, the diminishing light makes it harder to understand what is truly a diamond and what is just coal.
